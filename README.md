# MusicEmotionRecognition
This repository contains the code I used for a research paper titled "Using Music Emotion Recognition for Mental Health Relief." Paper will be added soon, abstract below:

Within the last decade, there has been a rise in mental health issues, especially amongst adolescents. Music therapy has been proven to be beneficial in aiding individuals who experience conditions such as anxiety or depression. Music therapists often create playlists based on emotion progressions. To help them filter through music to verify the emotion they are looking for, we created a model that verifies whether a song elicits a given emotion or not. Since musical features often dictate what mood songs convey, we used the MuSe dataset to help employ Music Emotion Recognition (MER) to determine whether a song elicits a certain emotional response. The dataset features songs and their perceived emotions, determined by user-generated tags, as well as their Spotify ID’s, which we used to obtain the songs’ musical features. After testing various classification algorithms, we found that KNN worked best at determining whether a song elicited a given emotion, with a precision of 68%. For further research, more insight into adolescent mental health, as well as more robust dataset and music features, can improve upon the results and create a more targeted user experience.
